        <p class="text">If you like a classic fruit punch, this is the best Monster flavor for you. And it comes in a can that’s covered in tattoo flash. It’s like if Hawaiian Punch went to a bunch of Orange County punk shows in the ’90s. Or, as Sporked staff writer Jordan Myrick put it, “This is what the Kool-Aid man’s cooler older brother who drives a motorcycle would drink.” Again, this has a nice, mild fizz that won’t burn your throat, and a big fruity “red drink” flavor that has notes of pineapple and other good, tropical things. Crank up some Vandals and hit the beach.</p>
